H2: Frequently Asked Questions
Q1: What is the difference between a crown and a bridge?
A crown covers and protects a single damaged tooth, while a bridge fills the gap of one or more missing teeth using neighboring teeth or implants for support.
Q2: Is the procedure painful?
No. Procedures are performed under local anesthesia. Patients may feel mild sensitivity after treatment, but this is temporary and easily managed.
Q3: What materials are used?
We use porcelain, zirconia, and porcelain-fused-to-metal. Porcelain and zirconia provide the most natural aesthetics and durability.
Q4: How long do crowns and bridges last?
With proper care, crowns and bridges typically last 10–15 years or longer. Good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups extend their lifespan.
Q5: Can crowns or bridges be repaired?
Minor issues can sometimes be fixed, but in many cases replacement is recommended for long-term success.
Q6: Why choose implant-supported bridges?
They provide stability without affecting adjacent teeth, preserve jawbone health, and feel more natural compared to traditional bridges.
Q7: Who is a good candidate?
Ideal candidates are those with damaged, weakened, or missing teeth who have healthy gums and good oral hygiene. Implant-supported solutions may also require adequate bone density.
