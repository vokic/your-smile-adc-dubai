6. FAQ – Dental Surgery in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Surgery
Q1: Is wisdom tooth extraction painful?
No. Wisdom tooth extractions are done under local anesthesia, so you won’t feel pain during the procedure. You may experience mild swelling or discomfort afterward, which usually subsides within a few days. Pain relief medication and a soft diet help ensure a smooth recovery.
Q2: How long does recovery take after oral surgery?
Recovery time depends on the type of procedure. Simple tooth extractions typically heal within 2–3 days, while wisdom tooth extractions may require up to a week. More complex procedures like bone grafting or jaw surgery can take a few weeks for full recovery. Our surgeons provide personalized aftercare instructions to speed up healing.
Q3: Do I need bone grafting before dental implants?
If you’ve experienced bone loss due to missing teeth, gum disease, or trauma, bone grafting may be necessary to rebuild the jaw and support implants. During your consultation, we use advanced imaging to determine whether bone grafting is required. Not all patients need it, but when recommended, it greatly improves implant success.
Q4: What is gum surgery, and when is it needed?
Gum surgery treats advanced periodontal disease, reshapes gum tissue, and restores oral health. It’s needed when gums recede, become infected, or cause loose teeth. Surgical treatment helps prevent further damage and tooth loss, while also improving smile aesthetics.
Q5: What is a frenectomy, and who needs it?
A frenectomy is a minor surgical procedure that removes or adjusts the small fold of tissue (frenum) under the tongue or upper lip. It’s commonly performed in children with tongue-tie or lip-tie, but adults can also benefit if the frenum restricts movement or causes gaps between teeth.
Q6: Is oral surgery safe?
Yes. When performed by qualified oral surgeons in a sterile, modern clinic, dental surgeries are safe and predictable. Our team uses advanced anesthesia options, strict sterilization protocols, and digital imaging to ensure precision and comfort at every step.
Q7: How do I prepare for dental surgery?
Before surgery, our team will review your medical history and advise you on fasting (if sedation is used), medications, and oral hygiene steps. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days, depending on the procedure.
Q8: What is jaw correction surgery, and who needs it?
Jaw correction (orthognathic surgery) is a procedure that aligns the upper and lower jaws to improve chewing, speech, breathing, and facial balance. It is recommended for patients with misaligned bites, jaw pain, or cosmetic concerns that cannot be corrected with orthodontics alone.
Q9: What aftercare is required following oral surgery?
After surgery, patients are advised to rest, avoid hard foods, maintain proper oral hygiene, and follow prescribed medications. Cold compresses reduce swelling, while follow-up visits ensure proper healing. Our team provides complete aftercare support to make recovery simple and stress-free.
