8. FAQ – Veneers in Dubai (neki dropdown)
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Veneers
Q1: How long do veneers last?
Porcelain veneers typically last between 10–15 years, while composite veneers last 4–7 years. Their longevity depends on daily care, regular dental check-ups, and avoiding habits like teeth grinding or biting hard objects. With proper maintenance, porcelain veneers can serve you for over a decade without losing their natural look.
Q2: Do veneers look natural?
Yes. Modern veneers are custom-made to match the color, shape, and size of your teeth. Porcelain veneers, in particular, mimic the translucency of natural enamel, making them indistinguishable from real teeth. When placed by experienced cosmetic dentists, veneers look and feel completely natural.
Q3: Are veneers painful?
The procedure is virtually pain-free. Before any preparation, a local anesthetic is applied to ensure maximum comfort. Some patients may experience mild sensitivity for a few days after the procedure, especially with porcelain veneers, but this usually subsides quickly.
Q4: What is the difference between porcelain and composite veneers?
●	Porcelain veneers are stronger, more durable, and stain-resistant. They provide the most natural appearance and can last over 10 years.
●	Composite veneers are applied directly to the tooth, making them a faster and more affordable option. However, they are less durable and may require touch-ups sooner.
Your dentist will recommend the best option depending on your smile goals and budget.
Q5: How much do veneers cost in Dubai?
The cost depends on the type of veneers and how many teeth you want to treat. Porcelain veneers in Dubai generally range from AED X–Y per tooth, while composite veneers start from AED Z. To get an accurate estimate tailored to your case, we recommend a consultation with our cosmetic team.
Q6: Can veneers chip or stain?
Porcelain veneers are stain-resistant and rarely chip if properly cared for. Composite veneers can stain over time and are more prone to wear, but can be easily polished or repaired. Regular check-ups and avoiding habits like nail-biting or chewing ice will help maintain their longevity.
Q7: Do veneers damage natural teeth?
To place veneers, a very thin layer of enamel is removed—usually less than 1 millimeter. This is necessary to ensure proper bonding and a natural fit. When performed by skilled dentists, the process does not harm your overall dental health and preserves as much of the natural tooth as possible.
Q8: Who is a good candidate for veneers?
Veneers are ideal for patients with discolored, chipped, slightly misaligned, or gapped teeth. However, they may not be suitable for those with severe tooth decay, gum disease, or heavy grinding habits. A consultation with our dentists will determine if veneers are the right choice for you.
Q9: How many veneers do I need?
This depends on your smile line. Some patients only need 2–4 veneers to cover imperfections, while others choose 6–10 for a full smile makeover. During your consultation, we’ll design a treatment plan that fits your goals, budget, and natural smile.
Q10: How do I take care of my veneers?
Veneers require the same care as natural teeth: brushing twice daily, flossing, and visiting your dentist regularly. Avoid using your teeth to open packages, and limit foods/drinks that cause stains (coffee, tea, red wine) for composite veneers. With proper care, veneers will keep your smile bright and confident for years.

6. FAQ – Dental Surgery in Dubai
●	Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Surgery
Q1: Is wisdom tooth extraction painful?
No. Wisdom tooth extractions are done under local anesthesia, so you won’t feel pain during the procedure. You may experience mild swelling or discomfort afterward, which usually subsides within a few days. Pain relief medication and a soft diet help ensure a smooth recovery.
Q2: How long does recovery take after oral surgery?
Recovery time depends on the type of procedure. Simple tooth extractions typically heal within 2–3 days, while wisdom tooth extractions may require up to a week. More complex procedures like bone grafting or jaw surgery can take a few weeks for full recovery. Our surgeons provide personalized aftercare instructions to speed up healing.
Q3: Do I need bone grafting before dental implants?
If you’ve experienced bone loss due to missing teeth, gum disease, or trauma, bone grafting may be necessary to rebuild the jaw and support implants. During your consultation, we use advanced imaging to determine whether bone grafting is required. Not all patients need it, but when recommended, it greatly improves implant success.
Q4: What is gum surgery, and when is it needed?
Gum surgery treats advanced periodontal disease, reshapes gum tissue, and restores oral health. It’s needed when gums recede, become infected, or cause loose teeth. Surgical treatment helps prevent further damage and tooth loss, while also improving smile aesthetics.
Q5: What is a frenectomy, and who needs it?
A frenectomy is a minor surgical procedure that removes or adjusts the small fold of tissue (frenum) under the tongue or upper lip. It’s commonly performed in children with tongue-tie or lip-tie, but adults can also benefit if the frenum restricts movement or causes gaps between teeth.
Q6: Is oral surgery safe?
Yes. When performed by qualified oral surgeons in a sterile, modern clinic, dental surgeries are safe and predictable. Our team uses advanced anesthesia options, strict sterilization protocols, and digital imaging to ensure precision and comfort at every step.
Q7: How do I prepare for dental surgery?
Before surgery, our team will review your medical history and advise you on fasting (if sedation is used), medications, and oral hygiene steps. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days, depending on the procedure.
Q8: What is jaw correction surgery, and who needs it?
Jaw correction (orthognathic surgery) is a procedure that aligns the upper and lower jaws to improve chewing, speech, breathing, and facial balance. It is recommended for patients with misaligned bites, jaw pain, or cosmetic concerns that cannot be corrected with orthodontics alone.
Q9: What aftercare is required following oral surgery?
After surgery, patients are advised to rest, avoid hard foods, maintain proper oral hygiene, and follow prescribed medications. Cold compresses reduce swelling, while follow-up visits ensure proper healing. Our team provides complete aftercare support to make recovery simple and stress-free.

FAQ – Orthodontics & Clear Aligners in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions
Q1: How long does orthodontic treatment take?
Treatment length depends on the complexity of your case. Traditional braces may take 18–24 months, while Invisalign and other clear aligners can sometimes achieve results in as little as 6–12 months for mild to moderate corrections. Your orthodontist will provide a personalized timeline after your initial consultation.
Q2: Are braces painful?
Braces are not painful during placement, but patients may feel pressure or mild discomfort for a few days after adjustments as the teeth begin to shift. This sensation is temporary and usually managed with over-the-counter pain relief if needed.
Q3: Braces vs Invisalign - which is better?
Both options straighten teeth effectively, but the choice depends on your needs:
●	Braces (metal or ceramic) are ideal for complex cases, severe misalignment, or bite corrections.
●	Invisalign clear aligners are nearly invisible, removable, and more comfortable for everyday life. They are best for mild to moderate corrections and for patients who prefer a discreet treatment option.
Q4: Can children get orthodontic treatment?
Yes. Orthodontics for children can start as early as age 7 for preventive treatments like space maintainers or bite correction. Traditional braces and clear aligners are suitable for older children and teens once most permanent teeth have erupted.
Q5: Do clear aligners really work as well as braces?
Yes, for many cases. Clear aligners like Invisalign are highly effective for crowding, gaps, and mild to moderate bite issues. However, for severe misalignments or jaw corrections, braces may still be the preferred option. Our orthodontists will advise the best treatment for your situation.
Q6: How often do I need check-ups during treatment?
With braces, check-ups are usually every 4–6 weeks for adjustments. With Invisalign, visits may be every 6–8 weeks, depending on your progress. Both systems require regular monitoring to ensure teeth are moving correctly.
Q7: What happens if I lose an aligner?
If you lose an Invisalign aligner, contact us immediately. Depending on your progress, we may order a replacement or move you to the next set. It’s important not to skip wearing aligners, as it can delay your treatment.
Q8: Will orthodontic treatment affect my speech?
Clear aligners may cause a slight lisp for the first few days, but most patients adapt quickly. Braces typically don’t affect speech once you get used to them.
Q9: Do results last forever?
Yes—if you wear your retainers as instructed. After orthodontic treatment, retainers are essential to maintain results. Without them, teeth may gradually shift back to their original positions. We provide customized retainers for long-lasting results.

8. FAQ – Dental Implants in Dubai
FAQ – Dental Implants in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Implants
Q1: How long do dental implants last?
With proper care, dental implants can last a lifetime. The implant post itself is designed to integrate with your jawbone permanently (osseointegration). The crown attached to the implant may need replacement after 10–15 years, depending on wear, but the implant foundation is built to last for decades.
Q2: Are dental implants painful?
The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so patients do not feel pain during surgery. Afterward, mild discomfort, swelling, or sensitivity can occur, but this usually subsides within a few days. Most patients describe implant surgery as far less painful than they expected, and recovery is generally smooth.
Q3: What is the recovery time for dental implants?
Initial healing usually takes 1–2 weeks. However, the full integration of the implant with the bone (osseointegration) can take 3–6 months, depending on your health and bone density. During this period, temporary crowns or dentures may be used, and once healing is complete, the permanent crown is placed.
Q4: Do I need bone grafting before getting implants?
If your jawbone has thinned or weakened due to tooth loss, gum disease, or trauma, bone grafting may be required to build enough bone for stable implant placement. Thanks to advanced 3D scans, our dentists can quickly determine whether bone grafting is necessary during your consultation.
Q5: How much do dental implants cost in Dubai?
The cost varies depending on how many teeth you are replacing, the type of implant system used, and whether additional treatments (such as bone grafting or sinus lift) are required. 
Q6: Are dental implants better than dentures or bridges?
Yes, implants offer advantages that dentures and bridges cannot: they are permanent, stable, and preserve bone health. Unlike dentures, implants do not slip or require adhesives. Unlike bridges, they don’t rely on grinding down adjacent teeth. Implants function and look like natural teeth, making them the gold standard for tooth replacement.
Q7: Am I a good candidate for dental implants?
Most adults with missing teeth are good candidates. Ideal candidates have healthy gums and enough bone density to support implants. Even if bone is lacking, bone grafting can often make implants possible. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, heavy smoking habits, or untreated gum disease may require additional preparation before implant surgery.
Q8: How safe are dental implants?
Dental implants are one of the safest and most predictable procedures in modern dentistry, with a success rate of over 95%. Using biocompatible titanium or ceramic materials ensures long-term safety and compatibility with your body. With proper hygiene and regular check-ups, implant complications are rare.
Q9: How do I take care of dental implants?
Implants should be cared for like natural teeth: brush twice daily, floss regularly, and visit your dentist for check-ups. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as these can slow healing and affect long-term success. With proper maintenance, implants remain healthy and functional for decades.
Q10: Can implants replace all my teeth?
Yes. Full-mouth dental implants or implant-supported dentures can restore an entire arch of missing teeth. Depending on your case, as few as 4-6 implants can support a full arch (All-on-4 or All-on-6 technique), providing a strong, stable, and natural-looking solution.

7. FAQ – Preventive Dentistry in Dubai
Q1: How often should I visit the dentist for a check-up?
Most patients should see a dentist every six months for a routine exam and cleaning. Regular visits allow us to catch early signs of cavities, gum disease, or other issues before they become serious. Some patients with gum problems or ongoing treatments may need more frequent visits.
Q2: Are professional dental cleanings painful?
No. Professional cleanings are generally painless. You may feel mild sensitivity if you have inflamed gums or tartar buildup, but our dentists use gentle techniques and modern tools to keep you comfortable throughout the procedure.
Q3: What are the signs of gum disease?
Common signs include bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, swollen or tender gums, and receding gum lines. If left untreated, gum disease can lead to tooth loss. Early detection and treatment are key to restoring gum health.
Q4: Do root canals hurt?
Root canals have a reputation for being painful, but with modern anesthesia and technology, they are virtually painless. Most patients report that the discomfort is no worse than getting a filling, and the treatment actually relieves the pain caused by infection.
Q5: Are fluoride treatments safe?
Yes. Fluoride treatments are completely safe when applied by a dentist. They strengthen enamel, help prevent cavities, and are especially beneficial for children and patients prone to tooth decay. The concentration used in professional settings is carefully controlled for safety.
Q6: Can children benefit from sealants?
Absolutely. Dental sealants are thin, protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of children’s molars. They prevent cavities by blocking bacteria and food particles from settling into deep grooves. Sealants are quick, painless, and can protect teeth for years.
Q7: What happens if I skip regular dental visits?
Skipping routine visits can allow small issues like cavities or gum inflammation to progress into more serious conditions. Preventive care saves you from discomfort, complex treatments, and potential tooth loss in the long run.
Q8: What’s the difference between preventive and general dentistry?
Preventive dentistry focuses on avoiding future problems - like cleanings, sealants, and fluoride, while general dentistry includes treating existing issues, such as fillings, root canals, and gum disease therapy. Both work hand in hand to keep your smile healthy for life.

Q6: Why choose implant-supported bridges?
They provide stability without affecting adjacent teeth, preserve jawbone health, and feel more natural compared to traditional bridges.
Q7: Who is a good candidate?
Ideal candidates are those with damaged, weakened, or missing teeth who have healthy gums and good oral hygiene. Implant-supported solutions may also require adequate bone density.

7. FAQ – Teeth Whitening in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Teeth Whitening
Q1: Is teeth whitening safe?
Yes. Professional teeth whitening performed by a dentist is safe and does not damage enamel or gums. Unlike over-the-counter kits, clinical treatments use controlled methods and biocompatible whitening agents to protect your teeth while removing deep stains.
Q2: How long do whitening results last?
Results typically last 6–12 months, depending on lifestyle and oral care. Patients who avoid excessive coffee, tea, red wine, or smoking usually enjoy brighter smiles for longer. Regular check-ups and occasional touch-up sessions help maintain results for years.
Q3: Does whitening damage enamel?
No. Professional whitening systems are designed to penetrate stains without harming enamel. Some temporary sensitivity can occur after treatment, but this usually resolves within a day or two.
Q4: How white can my teeth get?
The degree of whitening varies from person to person, depending on natural tooth color and stain depth. Most patients achieve teeth several shades lighter in a single session, resulting in a visibly brighter and more confident smile.
Q5: What’s the difference between laser whitening and home whitening kits?
Laser whitening provides immediate, dramatic results in one session under professional supervision. Home whitening kits, on the other hand, use lower-strength gels in custom trays, delivering gradual results over 1–2 weeks. Many patients combine both approaches for long-term brightness.
Q6: Can whitening remove all stains?
Teeth whitening works best on stains caused by food, drinks, and aging. However, it may not be as effective for intrinsic discoloration caused by medication, trauma, or enamel defects. In such cases, veneers or bonding may be recommended as alternatives.
Q7: Who is a good candidate for teeth whitening?
Most adults with healthy teeth and gums are good candidates. Whitening is not recommended for children, pregnant women, or patients with untreated cavities or gum disease. A dental consultation ensures the treatment is safe and effective for you.
Q8: Will whitening make my teeth sensitive?
Some patients may experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening, especially to cold foods and drinks. This sensitivity usually fades within 24–48 hours. Our dentists use protective gels and modern systems to minimize any discomfort.
