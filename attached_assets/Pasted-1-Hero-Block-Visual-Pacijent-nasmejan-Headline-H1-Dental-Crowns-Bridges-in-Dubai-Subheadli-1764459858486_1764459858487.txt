2. What Are Crowns & Bridges?
Headline (H2): Crowns & Bridges Explained
Microcopy:
Dental crowns act as protective caps that strengthen and restore damaged teeth, while dental bridges replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring an artificial tooth between healthy adjacent teeth or implants. Both solutions provide long-lasting, natural-looking results for improved oral health and confidence.

6. FAQ – Dental Crowns & Bridges in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions
Q1: What is the difference between a crown and a bridge?
A crown covers and protects a damaged or weakened tooth, while a bridge replaces one or more missing teeth by anchoring an artificial tooth to adjacent teeth or implants.
Q2: Is the procedure painful?
No. The treatment is done under local anesthesia to ensure comfort. Patients may feel mild sensitivity after placement, but this is temporary.
Q3: What materials are used for crowns and bridges?
We offer porcelain, zirconia, and porcelain-fused-to-metal. Porcelain and zirconia are popular choices due to their strength and natural tooth-like appearance.
Q4: How long do crowns and bridges last?
With proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups, crowns and bridges can last 10–15 years or longer.
Q5: Can crowns or bridges be repaired if damaged?
Minor adjustments may be possible, but often replacement is recommended to ensure long-term stability and aesthetics.
Q6: Who is a good candidate for crowns or bridges?
Crowns are ideal for patients with broken, cracked, or root canal-treated teeth, while bridges are suitable for patients missing one or more teeth with healthy surrounding support. Implant-supported bridges are an option when adjacent teeth are intact.
