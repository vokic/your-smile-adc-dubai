7. FAQ – Teeth Whitening in Dubai
Headline (H2): Frequently Asked Questions About Teeth Whitening
Q1: Is teeth whitening safe?
Yes. Professional teeth whitening performed by a dentist is safe and does not damage enamel or gums. Unlike over-the-counter kits, clinical treatments use controlled methods and biocompatible whitening agents to protect your teeth while removing deep stains.
Q2: How long do whitening results last?
Results typically last 6–12 months, depending on lifestyle and oral care. Patients who avoid excessive coffee, tea, red wine, or smoking usually enjoy brighter smiles for longer. Regular check-ups and occasional touch-up sessions help maintain results for years.
Q3: Does whitening damage enamel?
No. Professional whitening systems are designed to penetrate stains without harming enamel. Some temporary sensitivity can occur after treatment, but this usually resolves within a day or two.
Q4: How white can my teeth get?
The degree of whitening varies from person to person, depending on natural tooth color and stain depth. Most patients achieve teeth several shades lighter in a single session, resulting in a visibly brighter and more confident smile.
Q5: What’s the difference between laser whitening and home whitening kits?
Laser whitening provides immediate, dramatic results in one session under professional supervision. Home whitening kits, on the other hand, use lower-strength gels in custom trays, delivering gradual results over 1–2 weeks. Many patients combine both approaches for long-term brightness.
Q6: Can whitening remove all stains?
Teeth whitening works best on stains caused by food, drinks, and aging. However, it may not be as effective for intrinsic discoloration caused by medication, trauma, or enamel defects. In such cases, veneers or bonding may be recommended as alternatives.
Q7: Who is a good candidate for teeth whitening?
Most adults with healthy teeth and gums are good candidates. Whitening is not recommended for children, pregnant women, or patients with untreated cavities or gum disease. A dental consultation ensures the treatment is safe and effective for you.
Q8: Will whitening make my teeth sensitive?
Some patients may experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening, especially to cold foods and drinks. This sensitivity usually fades within 24–48 hours. Our dentists use protective gels and modern systems to minimize any discomfort.
