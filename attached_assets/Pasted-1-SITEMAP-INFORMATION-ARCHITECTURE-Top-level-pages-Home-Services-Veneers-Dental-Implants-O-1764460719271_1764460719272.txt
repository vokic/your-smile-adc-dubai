FAQ – Veneers in Dubai

(Keep answers concise but clear.)

H2: Frequently Asked Questions About Veneers

Q1: How long do veneers last?
Porcelain veneers typically last 10–15 years, and composite veneers around 4–7 years. Their longevity depends on your oral hygiene, habits, and regular dental check-ups.

Q2: Will my veneers look natural?
Yes. Veneers are custom-made to match your tooth shape, size, and color. Porcelain veneers mimic natural enamel, giving a realistic, translucent appearance.

Q3: Is getting veneers painful?
The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and is usually pain-free. You might feel mild sensitivity for a few days, which quickly settles.

Q4: Porcelain vs composite veneers – what’s the difference?
Porcelain is more durable, stain-resistant, and natural-looking; composite is more affordable and faster but may require touch-ups sooner. We’ll recommend the best option based on your goals and budget.

Q5: Do veneers damage my natural teeth?
We remove only a very thin layer of enamel to create space and ensure a perfect fit. When done by experienced dentists, veneers do not harm your dental health.

What Are Dental Implants?

H2: A Permanent Solution for Missing Teeth

Microcopy:
Dental implants replace missing teeth with titanium or ceramic roots that integrate with your jawbone. They feel, function, and look like natural teeth – without slipping, adhesives, or compromising nearby teeth.

FAQ – Dental Implants in Dubai

H2: Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Implants

(Shortened versions)

How long do implants last?
With proper care, implants can last a lifetime. The crown may need replacement after 10–15 years.

Is implant surgery painful?
No – it’s done under local anesthesia. Most patients report only mild discomfort afterward.

Do I need bone grafting?
Only if your jawbone is too thin or weak. We confirm this with 3D scans during your consultation.

Are implants better than dentures?
Implants are more stable, comfortable, and preserve bone, unlike removable dentures.

Can implants replace all my teeth?
Yes. Full-arch solutions (such as All-on-4 or All-on-6) can restore an entire jaw with a fixed bridge supported by implants.

Are braces painful?
You may feel pressure for a few days after adjustments, but this is temporary.

Can children have orthodontic treatment?
Yes – early evaluation from age 7 helps prevent more serious issues later.

Do results last forever?
