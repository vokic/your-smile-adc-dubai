7. FAQ – Preventive Dentistry in Dubai
Q1: How often should I visit the dentist for a check-up?
Most patients should see a dentist every six months for a routine exam and cleaning. Regular visits allow us to catch early signs of cavities, gum disease, or other issues before they become serious. Some patients with gum problems or ongoing treatments may need more frequent visits.
Q2: Are professional dental cleanings painful?
No. Professional cleanings are generally painless. You may feel mild sensitivity if you have inflamed gums or tartar buildup, but our dentists use gentle techniques and modern tools to keep you comfortable throughout the procedure.
Q3: What are the signs of gum disease?
Common signs include bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, swollen or tender gums, and receding gum lines. If left untreated, gum disease can lead to tooth loss. Early detection and treatment are key to restoring gum health.
Q4: Do root canals hurt?
Root canals have a reputation for being painful, but with modern anesthesia and technology, they are virtually painless. Most patients report that the discomfort is no worse than getting a filling, and the treatment actually relieves the pain caused by infection.
Q5: Are fluoride treatments safe?
Yes. Fluoride treatments are completely safe when applied by a dentist. They strengthen enamel, help prevent cavities, and are especially beneficial for children and patients prone to tooth decay. The concentration used in professional settings is carefully controlled for safety.
Q6: Can children benefit from sealants?
Absolutely. Dental sealants are thin, protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of children’s molars. They prevent cavities by blocking bacteria and food particles from settling into deep grooves. Sealants are quick, painless, and can protect teeth for years.
Q7: What happens if I skip regular dental visits?
Skipping routine visits can allow small issues like cavities or gum inflammation to progress into more serious conditions. Preventive care saves you from discomfort, complex treatments, and potential tooth loss in the long run.
Q8: What’s the difference between preventive and general dentistry?
Preventive dentistry focuses on avoiding future problems - like cleanings, sealants, and fluoride, while general dentistry includes treating existing issues, such as fillings, root canals, and gum disease therapy. Both work hand in hand to keep your smile healthy for life.
